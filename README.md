I created a classic Snake arcade game using the Ruy 2D library. To create this game, I followed along with a video tutorial. The purpose of this exercise was to practice following someone else's code as well as gain more experience working with Object Oriented Programming and GitHub. Additionally, it was pretty fun working with Ruby 2D! Thanks for playing
