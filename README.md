I created a classic Snake arcade game using the Ruby 2D library. To create this game, I followed along with a video tutorial. After the video, I decided to take the project a step further and added a High Score function. The purpose of this exercise was to practice following and understanding someone else's code as well as gain more experience working with Object Oriented Programming and GitHub. Additionally, it was pretty fun working with Ruby 2D! Thanks for playing!
